## 💻 College Event Feedback Analysis

**#FUTURE_INTERNS**

📊 **College Event Feedback Analysis**
This repository contains the source files for a comprehensive data analytics project designed to evaluate, visualize, and optimize institutional performance based on student satisfaction survey data.

✨ **Project Overview**

The dashboard provides an NLP-driven interactive interface for exploring complex survey data to extract **actionable institutional insights**. The central goal was to determine the **student satisfaction levels** across various departments by calculating accurate sentiment scores and identifying specific performance gaps in teaching, infrastructure, and mentoring.

🛠️ **Components**

The project consists of the following primary artifacts:

| File/Artifact | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Analysis_Notebook.ipynb** | The main Python notebook containing: Robust data cleaning for survey encodings; NLP-driven **Sentiment Analysis** using TextBlob; Automated generation of strategic visualizations. |
| **Processed_College_Feedback.csv** | The cleaned dataset containing standardized numeric ratings and calculated sentiment polarity scores for 580 survey responses. |
| **Visual Dashboards** | A set of high-resolution `.png` files including a **Detailed Performance Heatmap**, **Sentiment Distribution**, and **Thematic Word Clouds**. |

**Skill Area, Tools & Technologies**

| Skill Area | Tools & Technologies |
| --- | --- |
| **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** | **TextBlob** for Sentiment Polarity Analysis, Text Tokenization, and Keyword Extraction. |
| **Data Visualization** | **Seaborn & Matplotlib**, High-Resolution Heatmaps (RdYlGn), Question-wise Trend Lines, Interactive Word Clouds. |
| **Data Engineering** | **Python (Pandas)**, Encoding resolution (ISO-8859-1/UTF-8), Numeric Metric Standardization. |
| **Strategic Analysis** | Institutional Benchmarking, Sentiment Distribution, Actionable Improvement Recommendations. |

🔑 **Key Features**

* **NLP Sentiment Polarity:** Utilizes TextBlob to calculate accurate sentiment scores from student feedback, ensuring a precise understanding of campus morale beyond simple star ratings.
* **Thematic Keyword Analysis:** Integrated text processing to isolate top-frequency keywords (e.g., "**Teachers**," "**Skills**," "**Opportunities**"), identifying the primary drivers of student satisfaction.
* **Detailed Performance Heatmap:** Developed a transposed, high-resolution heatmap that maps 20+ survey questions against multiple courses to isolate department-specific "danger zones".
* **Actionable Gap Identification:** Delivers granular, data-backed insights that clearly identified critical priorities like **ICT tool usage** and **Mentoring for emotional growth**, both scoring **3.58/5.0**.
* **Data Model & Preparation:** Developed a resilient script that parses complex survey strings (e.g., "3.00/60.00") into clean float metrics for rigorous statistical analysis.
